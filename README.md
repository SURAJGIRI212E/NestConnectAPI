# Server Application

## Overview
This server application is designed to provide a robust backend solution using Node.js and MongoDB. It follows a modular architecture, separating concerns into different directories for configuration, controllers, models, routes, services, middlewares, utilities, and sockets.

## Folder Structure
```
server-app
├── config          # Configuration files for the application
├── controllers     # Controller functions for handling requests
├── models          # Mongoose models for MongoDB
├── routes          # Route definitions and setup
├── services        # Business logic and interactions with models
├── middlewares     # Middleware functions for request processing
├── utilities       # Utility functions for common tasks
├── sockets         # Real-time communication handling
├── .env            # Environment variables
├── package.json    # Project metadata and dependencies
└── server.js       # Entry point of the application
```

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd server-app
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your environment variables, such as:
   ```
   MONGODB_URI=<your-mongodb-connection-string>
   PORT=3000
   ```

4. **Run the Application**
   Start the server using:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

## Usage
Once the server is running, you can access the API endpoints defined in the routes. Use tools like Postman or curl to interact with the API.
